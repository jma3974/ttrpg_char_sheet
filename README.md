# Universal TTRPG Character Sheet

## Description


In light of various factors involving the overall table-top gaming community and industry, there has been some movement to change gaming systems. While TTRPG mechanics have some similar qualities, they are vastly unique, if for no other reason, that naming conventions. Not all publishers have invested in online presence, leaving players and gamemasters to rely on physical sheets, or homemade docs and/or spreadsheets. To that end, this is an ongoing project to build a web-based universal character sheet for table-top role playing games. I'm primarily looking at D&D 5e, Pathfinder 2E, Shadowrun, and Strange Worlds for initial approaches.

**Technologies used**

HTML and CSS will be a living experience as I slowly include new fields and test layouts based on the different systems.
Javscript for dunamically incorporating the properties, values, and descriptions of the various abilities a character possesses.


**Future plans**
The progress of this wil be contingent upon the growing skills I am learning and developing.

The first pass will be an initial layout of common properties and value fields. I will also attempt to incorporate some initial calculations.

The second pass will be developing the javascript necessary for updating information. This will be limited to instance of the browser until I learn about saving data locally and to a server.

The third iteration will be attempting to interconnect related properties (such as abilities to skills and feats).

The fourth pass will be to give the user the ability to change the layout.

There may be future passes to make depending on what I learn in this process. 

Every pass will involve re-examing HTML and CSS to accomodate the growing functionality.
